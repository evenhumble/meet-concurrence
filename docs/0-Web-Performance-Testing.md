# Web Performance Testing

A System under a given workload, then we measure following metrics:

- responsive
- throughput
- reliability
- scalability


In Real World:

- How many users? 
- How long ? Why short time and long time is different?
- How the user experience when serve big amount of users or 
  small group of users?

What we cared about:

- User Experience
- System Availability

## Turn User Experience into Tech Language

- Response Time not increased sharply
  * Throughput VS Response time
- How to handle the system crash or errors
  * Error Handler
- System not down

## Performance Testing Process

- Product Criteria
